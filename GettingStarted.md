##Overview##

This project will be a complete journey into the world of software architecture, learning typescript, and creating a chrome extension.

As a student attending Concordia University, the schedule builder is a neat tool for adding, dropping and planning a schedule for the semester. 
Inspired by a friend of mine's project, I wish to overhaul the student user experience in all aspects, keeping ease of use as the primary goal.

I will be writting down all thought processes, brainstorming, planning and progress done during the completion of this project.
The languages and packages I plan to use are typescript, javascript, html, css, react.
